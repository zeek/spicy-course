# Why Spicy?

Historically extending Zeek with new parsers required interacting with Zeek's
C++ API which was a significant barrier to entry for domain experts.

Spicy is a _domain-specific language_ for developing parsers for network protocols
or file formats which integrates well with Zeek.

## Flexible multi-paradigm language

With Spicy parsers can be
expressed in _declaratively_ in a format close to specifications, e.g., the
following TFTP `ERROR` message

```plain
#  2 bytes     2 bytes      string    1 byte
#  -----------------------------------------
# | Opcode |  ErrorCode |   ErrMsg   |   0  |
#  -----------------------------------------
```

can [be expressed in
Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/tutorial/index.html) as

```spicy
type Error = unit {
    code: uint16;
    msg:  bytes &until=b"\x00";
};
```

Spicy supports procedural code which can be
[hooked](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/programming/parsing.html#unit-hooks)
into parsing to support more complex parsing scenarios.

```spicy
function sum(a: uint64, b: uint64): uint64 { return a + b; }

type Fold = unit {
    a: uint8;
    b: uint8 &convert=sum(self.a, $$);
    c: uint8 &convert=sum(self.b, $$);
};
```

## Incremental parsing

The parsers generated by Spicy automatically support incremental parsing. Data
can be fed as it arrives without blocking until all data is available. Hooks
allow reacting to parsed results.

## Built-in safety

Spicy code is executed safely so many common errors are rejected, e.g.,

- integer under- or overflows
- incorrect use of iterators
- unhandled switch cases

## Integration into Zeek

Spicy parsers can trigger events in Zeek. Parse results can transparently be
made available to Zeek script code.
